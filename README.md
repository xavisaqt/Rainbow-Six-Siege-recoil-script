# Rainbow-Six-Siege-recoil-script
I made a logitech lua script that controls recoil, and it works with any logitech mouse

This is the one of many that actually work heres the guide on how to get it working if u dont allready know

step 1: download logitech g hub for windows. https://www.logitechg.com/en-nz/innovation/g-hub.html
step 2: after completing the setup click the three lines at the top left
step 3:after clicking the limes click "games & aplications"
step 4: under the profiles tab, there should be a preset profile named "default" you can either use that or create a new one
step 5: on that profile that u either made or used the preset ojne, beside details there should be a circle, if u hover ur mouse over it, it should say "scripting" click on that circle
step 6: once uve clicked scripting, there should be a usless preset script for an example to you, delte it and paste the script i have put in RecoilScript.lua (MAKE SURE TO PRESS CTRL + S after updating the script, if u dont nothing will save)
step 7, boom done u can now customise the strength of it on the thrid fourth fith and sixth loc.


How to get it working???

press right click (aim button) then once u click left click, it should pull ur mosue cursor down as if its controlling recoil


YOUR WELCOME
